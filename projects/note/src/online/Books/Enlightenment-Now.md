# Points

- Education
  - More than 80 percent of the world was unschooled; by 1900.
  - 83 percent of the world is literate.
  - Middle Eastern and North African countries, more than three-quarters of the
    people over sixty-five are illiterate, whereas the rate for those in their
    teens and twenties is in the single digits.
  - According to current projections, by the middle of this century, only five
    countries will have more than a fifth of their population uneducated, and by
    the end of the century the worldwide proportion will fall to zero.
  - Less-educated people reported having more leisure.
  - Early in the 19th century, 12 percent of the world could read and write;
    today 83 percent can.
- Politics
  - Engagement with politics is like sports fandom in another way: people seek
    and consume news to enhance the fan experience, not to make their opinions
    more accurate.
  - Liberals are more hostile and aggressive.
  - Conservatives are indeed more prejudiced against African Americans, but
    liberals turn out to be more prejudiced against religious Christians.
  - Conservatives are indeed more biased toward allowing Christian prayers in
    schools, but liberals are more biased toward allowing Muslim prayers in
    schools.
  - But just when we need this disinterested forum the most, academia has become
    more politicized as well—not more polarized, but more left-wing. Colleges
    have always been more liberal than the American population.
  - Many political commentators can recall a failure of peacekeeping forces
    (such as in Bosnia in 1995) and conclude that they are a waste of money and
    manpower. But when a peacekeeping force is successful, nothing photogenic
    happens, and it fails to make the news.
  - Three-quarters of the nonviolent resistance movements succeeded, compared
    with only a third of the violent ones. Gandhi and King were right, but
    without data, you would never know it.
- Improvement of world
  - Life expectancy across the world has risen from 30 to 71, and in the more
    fortunate countries to 81.
  - Rest in 2007 had reached the level of the West in 1950.
  - Netherlands, Scandinavia, and the United Kingdom, are the world’s most
    liberal, followed by the United States and other wealthy English-speaking
    countries, then Catholic and Southern Europe, then the former Communist
    countries of central Europe.
  - People recognize that democracies are relatively nice places to live, the
    idea of democracy can become contagious and the number can increase over
    time.
  - Life has been getting safer in every way. Over the course of the 20th
    century, Americans became 96 percent less likely to be killed in a car
    accident, 88 percent less likely to be mowed down on the sidewalk, 99
    percent less likely to die in a plane crash, 59 percent less likely to fall
    to their deaths, 92 percent less likely to die by fire, 90 percent less
    likely to drown, 92 percent less likely to be asphyxiated, and 95 percent
    less likely to be killed on the job.
  - “drugs are symptomatic of the rising value affluent societies place on human
    life. . . . Health research is displacing R&D that could have gone toward
    more mundane consumer products. Indeed, . . . the rising value of human life
    virtually dictates slower growth in regular consumer goods and services—and
    they constitute the bulk of measured GDP.” A natural interpretation is that
    this tradeoff is evidence for the acceleration of progress, not the
    stagnation of progress.
  - Muslims in the Middle East, the world’s most conservative culture, have
    values today that are comparable to those of young people in Western Europe.
- Improvement in Lifestyle
  - Time spent on laundry alone fell from 11.5 hours a week in 1920 to 1.5 in
    2014.14 For returning “washday” to our lives, Hans Rosling suggests, the
    washing machine deserves to be called the greatest invention of the
    Industrial Revolution.
  - Fact, single and working mothers today spend more time with their children
    than stay-at-home married mothers did in 1965.
  - Senior citizens today are richer than people of working age: the poverty
    rate for people over 65 plunged from 35 percent in 1960 to less than 10
    percent in 2011, well below the national rate of 15 percent.
  - Millennials seem to be in pretty good shape, happier and mentally healthier
    than their helicoptering parents.
- Human nature
  - Those with happy but meaningless lives are takers and beneficiaries; those
    with meaningful but unhappy lives are givers and benefactors.
  - Time spent with friends makes a life happier; time spent with loved ones
    makes it more meaningful.
  - People who feel they lead meaningful lives are more susceptible to stress,
    struggle, and worry.
  - Meaning, in contrast, registers the novel and expansive goals that are
    opened up for us as social, brainy, and talkative occupants of the uniquely
    human cognitive niche. We consider goals that are rooted in the distant past
    and stretch far into the future, that affect people beyond our circle of
    acquaintance, and that must be ratified by our fellows, based on our ability
    to persuade them of their worth and on our reputation for benevolence and
    efficacy.
  - People may be likelier to acknowledge a problem when they have reason to
    think it is solvable than when they are terrified into numbness and
    helplessness.
  - Governments pay parents to send their children to school, child labor
    plummets, which suggests that poor parents send their children to work out
    of desperation rather than greed.
  - People saw more infractions by the other team.
  - Exchange can make an entire society not just richer but nicer, because in an
    effective market it is cheaper to buy things than to steal them.
- Biases
  - People understand concepts only when they are forced to think them through,
    to discuss them with others, and to use them to solve problems.
  - People are less biased when they have skin in the game and have to live with
    the consequences of their opinions.
  - People are quite capable of reasoning in an unbiased manner, at least when
    they are evaluating arguments rather than producing them, and when they are
    after the truth rather than trying to win a debate.
  - To make public discourse more rational, issues should be depoliticized as
    much as is feasible.
  - When people hear about a new policy, such as welfare reform, they will like
    it if it is proposed by their own party and hate it if it is proposed by the
    other—all the while convinced that they are reacting to it on its objective
    merits.
  - People should take into consideration evidence that goes against their
    beliefs. It is more useful to pay attention to those who disagree with you
    than to pay attention to those who agree.
- Social Media
  - Users of social media have more close friends, express more trust in people,
    feel more supported, and are more politically involved.
  - Social media users care too much, not too little, about other people, and
    they empathize with them over their troubles rather than envying them their
    successes.
  - They are less likely to have a large number of friends but also less likely
    to want a large number of friend.
  - Just because social life looks different today from the way it looked in the
    1950s, it does not mean that humans, that quintessentially social species,
    have become any less social.
  - People see each other less in traditional venues like clubs, churches,
    unions, fraternal organizations, and dinner parties, and more in informal
    gatherings and via digital media.
- Tech
  - The more sophisticated and powerful a technology, the more people are needed
    to weaponize it.
  - And the more people needed to weaponize it, the more societal controls work
    to defuse, or soften, or prevent harm from happening.
  - That’s because hundreds of thousands of man-years of effort have gone into
    preventing this from happening, in the case of the internet, and millions of
    years of evolutionary effort to prevent species death, in the case of
    biology.
- Countries
  - Countries that combine free markets with more taxation, social spending, and
    regulation than the United States (such as Canada, New Zealand, and Western
    Europe) turn out to be not grim dystopias but rather pleasant places to
    live, and they trounce the United States in every measure of human
    flourishing, including crime, life expectancy, infant mortality, education,
    and happiness.
  - Developed countries are actually pretty happy, a majority of all countries
    have gotten happier, and as long as countries get richer they should get
    happier still.
  - The empirical picture at present suggests that people flourish most in
    liberal democracies with a mixture of civic norms, guaranteed rights, market
    freedom, social spending, and judicious regulation.
  - Whenever ethnic neighbors go for each other’s throats we read about it, but
    what about the neighborhoods that never make the news because they live in
    boring peace? What proportion of pairs of ethnic neighbors coexist without
    violence? The answer is, most of them: 95 percent of the neighbors in the
    former Soviet Union, 99 percent of those in Africa
- Cyber Attack
  - The strikes have mostly been nuisances such as doxing, namely leaking
    confidential documents or e-mail (as in the Russian meddling in the 2016
    American election), and distributed denial-of-service attacks, where a
    botnet (an array of hacked computers) floods a site with traffic.
  - Not a single person has ever been injured by a cyberattack.
- Weapon
  - The ban was driven by a widespread revulsion at the very idea, but the
    world’s militaries needed little convincing, because tiny living things make
    lousy weapons. They easily blow back and infect the weaponeers, warriors,
    and citizens of the side that uses them.
  - The biologist Paul Ewald notes that natural selection among pathogens works
    against the terrorist’s goal of sudden and spectacular devastation.
  - Germs that depend on rapid person-to-person contagion, like the common-cold
    virus, are selected to keep their hosts alive and ambulatory so they can
    shake hands with and sneeze on as many people as possible. Germs get greedy
    and kill their hosts only if they have some other way of getting from body
    to body, like mosquitoes (for malaria), a contaminable water supply (for
    cholera), or trenches packed with injured soldiers (for the 1918 Spanish
    flu).
  - If a nuclear bomb has been detonated on your territory, you know it. States
    can launch weapons from submarines, which hide in deep water, or from bomber
    aircraft, which can be sent scrambling, making the weapons invulnerable to a
    first strike and poised to exact devastating revenge.
- Forecasters
  - The forecasters who do the worst were the ones with Big Ideas—left-wing or
    right-wing, optimistic or pessimistic—which they held with an inspiring (but
    misguided) confidence. The more famous they were, and the closer the event
    was to their area of expertise, the less accurate their predictions turned
    out to be.
  - These experts gathered as much information from as many sources as they
    could. When thinking, they often shifted mental gears, sprinkling their
    speech with transition markers such as “however,” “but,” “although,” and “on
    the other hand.” They talked about possibilities and probabilities, not
    certainties. And while no one likes to say “I was wrong,” these experts more
    readily admitted it and changed their minds.47
  - They have personality traits that psychologists call “openness to
    experience” (intellectual curiosity and a taste for variety), “need for
    cognition” (pleasure taken in intellectual activity), and “integrative
    complexity” (appreciating uncertainty and seeing multiple sides).
  - They are anti-impulsive, distrusting their first gut feeling. They are
    neither left-wing nor right-wing. They aren’t necessarily humble about their
    abilities, but they are humble about particular beliefs, treating them as
    “hypotheses to be tested, not treasures to be guarded.”
  - They are aware of cognitive blind spots like the Availability and
    confirmation biases, and they discipline themselves to avoid them.
- Religions
  - Positive contributions of religions at particular times and places are
    education, charity, medical care, counseling, conflict resolution, and other
    social services.
  - Developed world these efforts are dwarfed by their secular counterparts; no
    religion could have decimated hunger, disease, illiteracy, war, homicide, or
    poverty on the scales.
  - It’s long been known that churchgoers are happier and more charitable than
    stay-at-homes, but
  - An atheist who has been pulled into a congregation by an observant spouse is
    as charitable as the faithful among the flock, whereas a fervent believer
    who prays alone is not particularly charitable.
  - 13 percent of the world’s population identified themselves as a “convinced
    atheist” in 2012, up from around 10 percent in 2005. 65 It would not be
    fanciful to say that over the course of the 20th century the global rate of
    atheism increased by a factor of 500, and that it has doubled again so far
    in the 21st.
  - An additional 23 percent of the world’s population identify themselves as
    “not a religious person,” leaving 59 percent of the world as “religious,”
    down from close to 100 percent a century before.
  - Countries with stronger safety nets are less religious, holding other
    factors constant.
  - When people become more intellectually curious and scientifically literate,
    they stop believing in miracles.
  - Better-educated countries have lower rates of belief.
  - The same holds true among the fifty states: the more religious the state,
    the more dysfunctional its citizens’ lives.
- Who care about you?
  - The next is the realization that this does not imply that life is
    meaningless, because people care about you, and vice versa.
  - You care about yourself, and you have a responsibility to respect the laws
    of the universe that keep you alive, so you don’t squander your existence.
  - Your loved ones care about you, and you have a responsibility not to orphan
    your children, widow your spouse, and shatter your parents.
  - And anyone with a humanistic sensibility cares about you, not in the sense
    of feeling your pain—human empathy is too feeble to spread itself across
    billions of strangers—but in the sense of realizing that your existence is
    cosmically no less important than theirs, and that we all have a
    responsibility to use the laws of the universe to enhance the conditions in
    which we all can flourish.
- Others
  - The mental health professions, and perhaps the culture at large, has been
    lowering the bar for what counts as a mental illness.
  - Any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered with the word no.
  - Not every problem is a crisis, a plague, or an epidemic, and among the
    things that happen in the world is that people solve the problems
    confronting them.

# Stories

When the data suggested that the gun-control measure lowered crime, all the
liberal numerates spotted it, and most of the conservative numerates missed
it—they did a bit better than the conservative innumerates, but were still wrong
more often than they were right. When the data showed that gun control increased
crime, this time most of the conservative numerates spotted it, but the liberal
numerates missed it; in fact, they did no better than the liberal innumerates.

Cultural pessimists saw the Y2K bug as comeuppance for enthralling our
civilization to technology. Among religious thinkers, the numerological link to
Christian millennialism was irresistible. The Reverend Jerry Falwell declared,
“I believe that Y2K may be God’s instrument to shake this nation, humble this
nation, awaken this nation and from this nation start revival that spreads the
face of the earth before the Rapture of the Church.” A hundred billion dollars
was spent worldwide on reprogramming software for Y2K Readiness, a challenge
that was likened to replacing every bolt in every bridge in the world.

In one cartoon of the new millennium, a father says to his young boy, “Son, your
mother and I have bought software to control what you see on the Internet. Um .
. . Could you install it for us?”

Spain was an economic laggard among Western countries, even though Spaniards
were highly schooled, because Spanish education was controlled by the Catholic
Church, and “the children of the masses received only oral instruction in the
Creed, the catechism, and a few simple manual skills. . . . Science,
mathematics, political economy, and secular history were considered too
controversial for anyone but trained theologians.”

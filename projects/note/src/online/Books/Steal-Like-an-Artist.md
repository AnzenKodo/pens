## Meaning

## Stories

Dr. Seuss wrote The Cat in the Hat with only 236 different words, so his editor
bet him he couldn’t write a book with only 50 different words. Dr. Seuss came
back and won the bet with Green Eggs and Ham , one of the bestselling children’s
books of all time.

Some mornings, when I can’t wake up, I lie in bed and read email and Twitter
until my blood starts boiling and I get fired up enough to spring out of bed.
But instead of wasting my anger on complaining or lashing out at people, I try
to channel it into my writing and my drawing.

I spent my teenage years obsessed with songwriting and playing in bands, but
then I decided I needed to focus on just writing, so I spent half a decade
hardly playing any music at all. The phantom limb pain got worse and worse.

About a year ago I started playing in a band again. Now, I’m starting to feel
whole. And the crazy thing is, rather than the music taking away from my
writing, I find it interacting with my writing and making it better—I can tell
that new synapses in my brain are firing, and new connections are being made.

“There isn’t a move that’s a new move.” The basketball star Kobe Bryant has
admitted that all of his moves on the court were stolen from watching tapes of
his heroes. But initially, when Bryant stole a lot of those moves, he realized
he couldn’t completely pull them off because he didn’t have the same body type
as the guys he was thieving from. He had to adapt the moves to make them his
own.

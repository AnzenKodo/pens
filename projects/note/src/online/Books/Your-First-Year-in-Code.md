1. Code is more about People then line.
2. Bad Tools can waste your time sometimes.
3. Don’t be religious about your tools it is just a tool not a human even a
   living thing.
4. Nobody cars about your code

- You can use whatever coding language or framework you want it is just a line
  of code that can change by anybody. It is doesn’t matter that much.
- It’s all about the product. The user cares about what you’ve built and how it
  solves their problem, not so much about how you got there.

1. Understanding the people using our software is the highest priority of
   development.
2. If you create something using company time or computers, it may legally
   belong to your employer, so check your contract to make sure you’re aware of
   that possibility.
3. Use a side project to remind myself why I love to code.
4. Well-organized folders and files. Most programming languages and frameworks
   have conventions for how things are organized.
5. Consistent code style. It doesn’t matter what styles you choose.
6. start with something simple: a tic-tac-toe game, an “About Me” web page, a
   metric unit converter.
7. Burned out

- I didn’t want to go to work when I woke up in the morning.
- You can potentially identify it through a decrease in work performance or
  long-term changes in mood, it can be as simple as asking if they are okay
- Engaging in non-work related hobbies and activities.
- Keep your personal life separate from your work life.

1. Be the change you wish to see in our industry.
2. What I call myself

- Coder had the lowest Glassdoor salary of any position I looked at, even lower
  than Junior Software Developer.
- The programmer is a term that’s gone the way of the dinosaur.
- The developer is, as previously noted, an unnecessarily ambiguous title. If
  your job involves building condominiums, you’re reading the wrong book.
- Front End Developer is a very volatile title. Not only does it have almost the
  highest salary variability of all the job titles researched, but anecdotally
  I’ve heard it defined in contradictory ways.
- JavaScript Developer, a Vue Developer, or a .NET Engineer, and this is a good
  name.

1. DevOps

- The DevOps discipline was created to bridge the gap between developers and
  operations people.
- The container, for the sake of simplicity, can be thought of like a tiny
  operating system that runs on top of your existing one and is completely
  portable.
- If you don’t understand something, Google it. If you can’t figure it out
  easily, ask. No one expects you to know everything and you never have to.
- If someone has told you otherwise, you’re in the wrong company. Automate as
  much as you can. Anything that has to be done manually is error-prone and far
  more time-consuming.
- Never stop learning. DevOps is a great field and is evolving rapidly. You need
  to keep your knowledge up to avoid becoming outdated or obsolete.

1. If you know how to write clear and organized documentation, you can reduce
   these expenses dramatically.
2. Good planning helps to avoid wasted time and effort if the requirements
   change or a solution already exists.
3. Valuing simplicity and trusting their developers.
4. Any standard that a group of experts has decided is the “best way” to do
   something.
5. The three virtues.

- Laziness: The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall
  energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people
  will find useful and document what you wrote so you don’t have to answer so
  many questions about it.
- Impatience: The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you
  write programs that don’t just react to yo needs, but actually anticipate
  them. Or at least pretend to.
- Hubris: The quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other
  people won’t want to say bad things about.

# Q&A

1. When you’re first reading about something new in code.

- Why is this important or useful?
- How does it fit with other topics or technologies?
- What’s the problem that it’s trying to solve?

# Points

1. The best bet is to blindly generate novel ideas and gather more feedback from
   fellow creators to hone his vision about which ones might prove useful. As an
   investor, you’ll be able to see more clearly, but you’ll still be making
   one-eyed gambles.
2. Don’t change the system rather aimed to earn status by becoming part of the
   system and then changing it from within.
3. Agreeable and Disagreeable

- Agreeable- people were happiest in the moments when they doled out compliments
  and praise, smiled and laughed with others, expressed affection, reassured
  others, and compromised.
- Disagreeable- people’s greatest joy when they were criticizing, confronting,
  or challenging others.

1. The fall from low to lower hardly hurts. The fall from the middle to low is
   devastating.
2. Research shows that the mistakes we regret are not errors of commission, But
   errors of omission.
3. Pioneers and Settlers

- The pioneers were first movers the initial company to develop or sell a
  product.
  - 47 percent of the failure rate.
  - 10% of the market share.
- The settlers were slower to launch, waiting until the pioneers had c treated a
  market before entering.
  - 8 percent of the failure rate.
  - 22% of the market share.
  - Settlers are often branded as copycats, but this stereotype misses the mark.
    Instead of conforming to the existing demand, they bide their time until
    they’re ready to introduce something new. Slow to enter because they’re
    working on revolutionary products, services, or technology.

1. One study of over three thousand startups indicates that roughly three out of
   every four fail because of premature scaling—**making investments that the
   market isn’t yet ready to support**.
2. The key lesson here is that if you have an original idea, it’s a mistake to
   rush with the sole purpose of beating your competitors to the finish line.
3. Conceptual & Experimental innovators

- Conceptual innovators formulate a big idea and set out to execute it.
  - Conceptual innovators did their most influential work at 48.
  - Under 30s years, exactly half were conceptual innovators.
  - Conceptual innovators tend to generate original ideas early but risk
    copying, themselves.
- Experimental innovators solve problems through trial and error, learning, and
  evolving as they go along.
  - Experimental innovators did theirs at 61.
  - 45+ years, 92 percent did experimental work.
  - The experimental approach takes longer, but proves more renewable: **instead
    of reproducing our past ideas, experiments enable us to continue discovering
    new one’s**.
  - :eight_spoked_asterisk: To sustain our originality as we age and accumulate
    expertise, our best bet is to adopt an experimental approach.

1. **The more experiments you run, the less constrained you become by your ideas
   from the past.** Instead of getting mired in the tunnel vision of your
   imagination, by looking out into the world, you improve the acuity of your
   peripheral vision.
2. The message was clear: if you were a true believer, you’d be all in. The more
   strongly you identify with an extreme group, **the harder you seek to
   differentiate yourself from more moderate groups that threaten your values**.
3. Shared tactics only facilitate alliances up to a point. **When the overlap in
   tactics between groups was more than 61 percent, coalitions became less
   likely**. When their methods are pretty much the same, groups simply have
   less to learn and gain from one another; their efforts are more likely to be
   redundant.
4. You should start with why and this is excellent advice—unless you’re doing
   something original that challenges the status quo.
5. Negative & Ambivalent Relationship

- Negative relationships are unpleasant, but they’re predictable: if a colleague
  consistently undermines you, you can keep your distance and expect the worst.
- Ambivalent relationship, you’re constantly on guard, grappling with questions
  about when that person can actually be trusted.
  - Ambivalent relationships are literally unhealthier than negative
    relationships.

1. Our best allies aren’t the people who have supported us all along. They’re
   the ones who started out against us and then came around to our side.

- Moving forward, to avoid the cognitive dissonance of changing their minds yet
  again, they’ll be especially motivated to maintain a positive relationship.
- People were most persuaded to change their opinions by those who had started
  out negative and then become more positive.

1. Instead of assuming that others share our principles, or trying to convince
   them to adopt ours, we ought to present our values as a means of pursuing
   theirs.

- **It’s hard to change other people’s ideas. It’s much easier to link our
  agendas to familiar values that people already hold.**
- As much as you want to be straightforward with potential partners, originals
  occasionally need to reframe their ideas to appeal to their audience.

1. Overall, later borns were twice as likely as firstborns to take risks.

- Younger brothers were 10.6 times more likely than their older siblings to
  attempt to steal a base.
- Darwin released his famous findings. Prior to Darwin, 56 of 117 later borns
  believed in evolution, compared with only 9 of 103 firstborns.
- An 80-year-old later-born was as open to evolutionary theory as a 25-year-old
  firstborn.

1. Good explanations enable children to develop a code of ethics that often
   coincides with societal expectations.
2. Instead of “Please don’t cheat,” changed the appeal to “Please don’t be a
   cheater.”

- When you’re urged not to cheat, you can do it and still see an ethical person
  in the mirror.
- But when you’re told not to be a cheater, the act casts a shadow; immorality
  is tied to your identity, making the behavior much less attractive.

1. Human rights advocate Malala Yousafzai was moved by reading biographies of
   Meena, an activist for equality in Afghanistan, and of **Martin Luther King,
   Jr. King was inspired by Gandhi, as was Nelson Mandela**.
2. Across industries, there were three dominant templates: professional, star,
   and commitment.

- The professional blueprint emphasized hiring candidates with specific skills:
  Founders looked for engineers who could code in JavaScript or C++ or
  scientists who had a deep knowledge about synthesizing proteins.
  - Failure rates we’re were worse.
- In the star blueprint, the focus shifted from current skills to future
  potential, placing a premium on choosing or poaching the brightest hires. The
  individuals in question might have less current expertise in a particular
  area, but they had the raw brainpower to acquire it.
  - Founders with professional and star blueprints gave employees autonomy and
    challenging tasks.
  - Failure rates were substantial for the star blueprint.
- Founders with a commitment blueprint went about hiring differently. **Cultural
  fit was a must.** The top priority was to employ people who matched the
  company’s values and norms.
  - Commitment blueprints worked to build strong emotional bonds among employees
    and to the organization.
  - They often used words like family and love to describe the companionship in
    the organization, and employees tended to be intensely passionate about the
    mission.
  - When founders had a commitment blueprint, the failure rate of their firms
    was zero—not a single one of them went out of business.
  - A better chance of making it to the stock market.
  - Odds of an initial public offering more than triple those of the star model
    and more than quadruple those of the professional model.
  - Firms with commitment blueprints grew their stock values 140 percent slower
    than star blueprints and 25 percent slower than professional blueprints.
  - Commitment firms have greater difficulty attracting, retaining, or
    integrating a diverse workforce.
  - Once a market becomes dynamic, big companies with strong cultures are too
    insular: They have a harder time recognizing the need for change, and
    they’re more likely to resist the insights of those who think differently.
    As a result, they don’t learn and adapt and don’t have better or more
    reliable financial results than their competitors.

1. The more **CEOs sought advice from friends and colleagues who shared their
   perspectives. They favored the comfort of consensus over the discomfort** of
   dissent, which was precisely the opposite of what they should have done.

- Company performance only improved when CEOs actively gathered advice from
  people who weren’t their friends and brought different insights to the table.

1. Dissenting opinions are useful even when they’re wrong.
2. Firms that deviated from the founder’s original blueprint had 2.3 times
   higher odds of failure compared to similar firms that stayed with the
   founder’s original model.

- Even a small adjustment was enough to cause big problems. More than half of
  the firms that shifted their blueprints only made one change, like hiring on
  potential instead of skills, but they suffered anyway.
- Overall, changing the blueprint had a more negative impact than replacing the
  founder.
- The negative effects of the change were most pronounced for firms with
  commitment blueprints.

1. If you hire people who fit your culture, you’ll end up with people who
   reinforce rather than challenge one another’s perspectives.

- At IDEO, the design consulting firm that created the mouse for Apple, managers
  throw culture fit out the window, focusing instead on how potential candidates
  can improve the culture.

1. When you have a preference, groups would need to consider more articles
   against it than in support of it.
2. You have to raise the problems before pursuing solutions.
3. The fact that early in the training, employees are encouraged to question the
   principles. Rather than waiting for employees to become experienced.
4. The more principles you have, the greater the odds that employees focus on
   different values or interpret the same values differently.
5. “Shapers” are independent thinkers: curious, non-conforming, and
   **rebellious**. They practice brutal, nonhierarchical honesty. And they act
   in the face of risk because their fear of not succeeding exceeds their fear
   of failing.
6. When self-doubts creep in, defensive pessimists don’t allow themselves to be
   crippled by fear.

- They deliberately imagine a disaster scenario to intensify their anxiety and
  convert it into motivation.
- Once they’ve considered the worst, they’re driven to avoid it, considering
  every relevant detail to make sure they don’t crash and burn, which enables
  them to feel a sense of control.
- Their confidence springs not from ignorance or delusions about the
  difficulties ahead, but from a realistic appraisal and an exhaustive plan.
- Research shows that when **American presidents’ inaugural addresses feature
  positive thoughts about the future, employment rates, and gross domestic
  product decline during their terms in office**. When presidents are too
  optimistic, the economy gets worse. Negative thoughts can direct our attention
  to potential problems, and the absence of those thoughts predicts a failure to
  take preventative and corrective actions.

1. Neuroscience research suggests that when we’re anxious, the unknown is more
   terrifying than the negative.
2. When you feeling negative try to say “I am excited”.
3. If you want people to go out on a limb, you need to show them that they’re
   not alone.
4. Use humor as a weapon against fear.
5. We can dramatically shift risk preferences just by changing a few words to
   emphasize losses rather than gains.
6. If you want people to take risks, you need first to show what’s wrong with
   the present.
7. Research demonstrates that when we’re angry at others, we aim for retaliation
   or revenge. But when we’re angry for others, we seek out justice and a better
   system. We don’t just want to punish; we want to help.
8. **Instead of taking the status quo for granted, ask why it exists in the
   first place.** When you remember that rules and systems were created by
   people, it becomes clear that they’re not set in stone—and you begin to
   consider how they can be improved.
9. Immerse yourself in a new domain.
10. When you’re generating new ideas, deliberately stop when your progress is
    incomplete. By taking a **break in the middle of your brainstorming or
    writing process, you’re more likely to engage in divergent thinking and give
    ideas time to incubate**.
11. It’s hard to judge your own ideas, because you tend to be too enthusiastic,
    and you can’t trust your gut if you’re not an expert in the domain. It’s
    also tough to rely on managers, who are typically too critical when they
    evaluate ideas. **To get the most accurate reviews, run your pitches by
    peers—they’re poised to spot the potential and the possibilities.**
12. Remember that if you don’t take initiative, the **status quo will persist**.
13. You can create urgency by implementing the “kill the company” exercise from
    Lisa Bodell, CEO of futurethink. Gather a group together and invite them to
    spend an hour brainstorming about **how to put the organization out of
    business**—or decimate its most popular product, service, or technology.
    Then, hold a discussion about the most serious threats and how to convert
    them into opportunities to transition from defense to offense.
14. Ask for problems, not solutions.

- You can create an open document for teams to flag problems that they see. On a
  monthly basis, bring people together to review them and figure out which ones
  are worth solving.

1. When misbehave, help them see how their actions hurt other people. “How do
   you think this made her feel?”.
2. Emphasize values over rules.

# Story

Ban the words like , love , and hate . At the nonprofit DoSomething.org, CEO
Nancy Lublin forbade employees from using the words like, love, and hate,
because they make it too easy to give a visceral response without analyzing it.
Employees aren’t allowed to say they prefer one Web page over another; they have
to explain their reasoning with statements like “This page is stronger because
the title is more readable than the other options.” This motivates people to
contribute new ideas rather than just rejecting existing ones.

Martin Luther King, Jr., too, was an experimental innovator. Despite being just
thirty-four when he gave his “dream” speech, it was his twentieth year of
speaking publicly about civil rights. At fifteen, he made the state finals for
delivering an original speech on civil rights. He spent the intervening decades
testing out a range of possible lyrics to articulate his vision. In the
thousands of speeches that he delivered, he was constantly rehearsing different
melodies and refrains.

Shifting the focus from why to how can help people become less radical. In a
series of experiments, when people with extreme political views were asked to
explain the reasons behind their policy preferences, they stuck to their guns.
Explaining why gave them a chance to affirm their convictions. But when asked to
explain how their preferred policies work, they became more moderate.
Considering how led them to confront the gaps in their knowledge and realize
that some of their extreme views were impractical.

Emphasizing consequences for others can motivate adults, too. In hospitals, to
encourage doctors and nurses to wash their hands more often, my colleague David
Hofmann and I posted two different signs near soap and gel dispensers:

```
Hand hygiene prevents you from catching diseases.
```

```
Hand hygiene prevents patients from catching diseases.
```

The **sign on the left had no effect whatsoever**. The sign on the right made a
significant difference: merely mentioning patients instead of you led medical
professionals to wash their hands **10 percent more often and use 45 percent
more soap and gel**.

When hundreds of women who graduated from Radcliffe College were asked in their
early thirties to name the people who had the greatest influence on their lives,
the vast majority mentioned parents and mentors. Seventeen years later,
psychologists Bill Peterson and Abigail Stewart measured the women’s commitments
to changing things for the better for future generations. Naming a parent as a
major influence accounted for less than one percent of the women’s motivations
to drive meaningful change. The women who were pursuing originality had been
influenced a decade and a half earlier not by their parents, but by their
mentors.

While Kodak hired men with advanced science degrees, Land sought a more diverse
workforce, employing women with artistic backgrounds and men straight out of the
navy. Just like the Silicon Valley founders with commitment blueprints, he
didn’t worry about the specific skills or star qualities of the people he took
on; his focus was rather on whether they would value-generating novel ideas and
dedicate themselves to the mission. Surrounded by others who shared the same
passions and goals, his employees felt a strong sense of belonging and
cohesiveness. When you’re bonded that strongly with your colleagues and your
organization, it’s hard to imagine working anywhere else.

When I polled executives and students about the strongest culture they had ever
encountered in an organization, the landslide winner was Bridgewater Associates.
Headquartered in a Connecticut town, **Bridgewater handles over $170 billion in
investments for governments, pension funds, universities, and charities. Its
philosophy is outlined in a set of over two hundred principles written by the
founder.** Although the company manages money, the principles don’t contain a
word about investing. They are maxims about how to think and act in any
situation you might encounter at work or in life if you want to do meaningful
work and build meaningful relationships.

The principles have been downloaded more than two million times. New employees
are hired based on an assessment of how well they fit with the way of operating
that’s outlined in the principles. They are trained in an intensive boot camp
modeled after the military, where they are asked to reflect on and discuss the
principles, placed in emotionally intense situations to practice them, and
evaluated on how well they integrate them into their behaviors. Although there’s
always a lot of debate, Bridgewater is a highly cohesive, close-knit community,
to the point that its staff frequently call it a family, and it’s common for
employees to stay for decades.

Bridgewater has a strong commitment culture in the volatile financial industry,
but its performance hasn’t waned over time. The company has two major funds,
both of which have delivered consistently excellent returns through two decades.
They’ve been recognized for making more money for clients than any hedge fund in
the history of the industry. In 2010, Bridgewater’s returns exceeded the
combined profits of Google, eBay, Yahoo, and Amazon.

Bridgewater’s billionaire founder, Ray Dalio. Although he has been called the
Steve Jobs of investing, employees don’t communicate with him as if he’s anyone
special. Here’s an email that Jim, a client adviser, sent to Dalio after a
meeting with an important potential client:

> Ray— you deserve a “D-” for your performance today . . . you rambled for 50
> minutes . . . It was obvious to all of us that you did not prepare at all
> because there is no way you could have and been that disorganized at the
> outset if you had prepared. We told you this prospect has been identified as a
> “must-win” . . . today was really bad . . . we can’t let this happen again.

But instead of reacting defensively, Dalio responded by asking others who
attended the meeting to give him honest feedback and grade him on a scale from A
to F.

At Bridgewater, **they’re evaluated on whether they speak up—and they can be
fired for failing to challenge the status quo**.

Story from 1983 of how Chilean miners had mounted a protest against the
country’s dictator, Pinochet. Instead of taking the risk of going on strike,
they are sued for a nationwide call for citizens to demonstrate their resistance
by turning their lights on and off. People weren’t afraid to do that, and soon
they saw that their neighbors weren’t, either. The miners also invited people to
start driving slowly. Taxi drivers slowed down; so did bus drivers. Soon,
pedestrians were walking in slow motion down the streets and driving their cars
and trucks at a glacial pace.

resourceful, and connected.

# What I am going to to do after reading it?

- Make database of people & and how often I should contact them.
- Build some persona for people to look up to.
- Never give to I am contacting someone.

# Points

- Socialize
  - How to use friends database?
    - Every person you’ve ever met has the potential to help you.
    1. A list: Very important people. Contact every three weeks.
    2. B list: Important people. Contact every two months.
    3. C list: Most people. Contact every six months.
    4. D list: Demoted people. Contact once a year, to make sure you still have
       their correct info.
  - Normal World & Business World
    - As teenagers, we learned the hard way that if you contact someone and they
      don’t reply, they’re just not into you. If you keep trying, you must be a
      total loser.
    - But in the business world, it’s the opposite. If you don’t keep trying,
      you’re a loser!
  - How to be cool?
    - But people want someone to look up to. Someone who’s not of their normal
      boring world. Someone who’s being who they wish they could be, if they had
      the courage.
    - It takes some extra effort to look and act cool instead of normal, but
      it’s considerate and part of your art.
    - Look back at artists like Andy Warhol or Miles Davis, who were not only
      great at their art, but also knew how to play their image — to be cool.
    - You have to give people a good reason! Say a few words to make them
      curious.
    - Make public persona — the image you show the world — should be an extreme
      character. It can be a version of yourself, or it can be a mask.
  - About People
    - Are fans telling friends? If not, don’t promote.
    - Even if it starts professional, get personal as soon as possible. Be a
      friend. That’s how things are done
    - We love when someone hates the same thing we hate — especially if that
      thing is popular.
    - Take some of that searching time, and spend it on keeping in touch with
      your existing contacts.
- Business
  - How beat competitor?
    - Look at what your competitors are doing, then vow not to do that.
    - Don’t try to beat them at their game.
    - Play a completely different game.
    - Be radically opposite
  - Early adopters & Late adopters
    - Give a few early adopters the courage to jump in together with the first.
      Make sure they stick together as a group.
    - Now it’s not about you, it’s about them. Publicize the group, not
      yourself. Make it fun to join.
    - Make sure all late-adopters can see what fun the early adopters are
      having.
  - Don’t reinvent any of these wheels. Focus on what’s left — what hasn’t been
    done.
    - Video aspect? Let YouTube handle that part. E-Commerce aspect? Use
      Amazon’s system. Payments? Use Stripe.
  - If you do it persistently enough, you will own that niche. People will not
    be able to imagine that niche without you.
  - Ask yourself why a certain headline or photo or article caught your
    attention
  - My advice is to assume nobody is coming. It’s more useful to assume that
    it’s all up to you. This is not hopeless, but helpful and empowering.
  - Pour your personality and philosophy into the way you do business.
  - Nobody knows the future, and anyone who pretends to know can’t be trusted

# Meaning

**Market mindset** - strictly business: being paid for time and effort,
competition, you get what you pay for, and cost/benefit analysis.

**Social mindset** - is warm and fuzzy social human nature: helping friends,
being a good generous person, doing what’s right.

**Money** - neutral exchange of value. If people give you money, it’s proof that
you’re giving them something valuable in return.

**Marketing** - Marketing means making it easy for people to notice you, relate
to you, remember you, and tell their friends about you.

# Stories

How dealt with the flood:

Whenever someone sent their music, it would go into an inbox. That inbox was
completely ignored.

Whenever someone contacted her to follow-up the first time, to ask if she’d
received it, she would take their music out of that first inbox, and put it in a
second inbox. That second inbox was also ignored.

Then if they followed-up with her a second time, asking again if she’d had the
chance to listen, she would take their music out of the second inbox, and put it
in a third inbox. That third inbox would get a listen if she had some spare
time.

Finally, if they followed-up a third time, she would take their music out of the
third inbox, and make it a priority to give it a real listen.

One of the top music industry lawyers in Los Angeles was speaking at a
conference.

She’s an expert in copyright law, so someone asked her advice on a licensing
problem. They had recorded their version of a famous song, but were unable to
get the rights to sell it because they couldn’t get a response from the
publisher.

The lawyer shocked the audience when she said, “Sell it anyway. Don’t wait for
permission. Save the proof that you tried your best to reach them. If they
contact you to ask for money some day, pay them then. But never wait.”

Coming from a copyright lawyer, that was a bold statement.

It was a reminder that your career is more important than its details.

Success is your top priority. Never let anything stop you.

Many musicians get into music because they love playing their instrument. They
love it so much they want to do it full-time. But then well-meaning people say,
“If you’re going to be in the music business, you have to read this book on
music business law, and you have to learn networking skills, and marketing, and
tech skills, and accounting, and writing good newsletters, and blah blah blah.”
Soon those musicians are spending all their time doing everything but playing
their instrument, and decide it’s not worth it! They give up, get a dumb job,
and lose interest in their instrument, because a career in music seems tedious
and overwhelming.

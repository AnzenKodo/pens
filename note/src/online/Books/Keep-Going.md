# Stories

The writer David Sedaris is a born tidier. He tells childhood stories about
vacuuming and cleaning up after his siblings. When he sold his first book, he
was cleaning houses in Manhattan. Now he’s a rich bestselling author and lives
in a village west of London. Do you know how he spends most of his day? Picking
up trash on the side of the road.

That’s right: One of our most popular living authors estimates that he a garbage
truck after him: “Pig Pen Sedaris.” He’s best known to his neighbors as a litter
picker. When the West Sussex County Times wrote about him, they didn’t even
mention he was a writer.

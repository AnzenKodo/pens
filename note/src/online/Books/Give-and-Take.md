# Points

1. Giver Vs Taker

- When takers win, there’s usually someone else who loses.
  - Research shows that people tend to envy successful takers and look for ways
    to knock them down a notch.
  - Takers tend to be **self-absorbed, they’re more likely to use first-person
    singular pronouns like I, me, mine, my, and me —versus first-person plural
    pronouns like we, us, our, ours, and ourselves**.
  - In the computer industry, when talking about the company, on average, 21
    percent of CEOs’ first-person pronouns were in the singular. For the extreme
    takers, 39 percent of their first-person pronouns were in the singular. Of
    every ten words that the taker CEOs uttered referencing themselves, four
    were about themselves alone and no one else.
  - The **taker CEOs earned far more money than other senior executives** in
    their companies. The takers saw themselves as superior, so they felt
    entitled to substantial pay discrepancies in their own favor.
  - In the computer industry study, when taker CEOs were at the helm, firms
    **had more fluctuating, extreme performance, as measured by total
    shareholder returns and return on assets. They had bigger wins, but bigger
    losses.** The takers were supremely confident in their bets, so they swung
    for the fences. They made bold, grandiose moves, which included more and
    larger acquisitions, as well as major upheavals to company strategy.
    Sometimes these moves paid off, but in the long run, the takers often put
    their companies in jeopardy.
  - [Giver and Taker](https://photos.app.goo.gl/oD8CY1bvWHL9kmc97) On the left
    side is giver right side is a taker. For the taker CEOs, it was all about
    me. A big photo is self-glorifying.
- When givers win, people are rooting for them and supporting them, rather than
  gunning for them.
  - Givers succeed in a way that creates a ripple effect, enhancing the success
    of people around them.

1. Networks come with three major advantages: private information, diverse
   skills, and power.

- By developing a strong network, people can gain invaluable access to
  knowledge, expertise, and influence.

1. At some point in your life, you’ve probably experienced the frustration of
   dealing with slick schmoozers who are nice to your face when they want a
   favor, but end up stabbing you in the back—or simply ignoring you—after they
   get what they want. **This faker style of networking** casts the entire
   enterprise as Machiavellian, a self-serving activity in which people make
   connections for the sole purpose of advancing their own interests.
2. When **people get burned by takers, they punish them by sharing reputational
   information**. Gossip represents a widespread, efficient, and low-cost form
   of punishment. When reputational information suggests that someone has taker
   tendencies, we can withhold trust and avoid being exploited. Over time, as
   **their reputations spread, takers end up cutting existing ties and burning
   bridges with potential new ties**.

# Storys

---

Early in 1994, five years before seeking Spencer’s help, Rifkin became enamored
with an emerging band. He wanted to help the band gain popularity, so he put his
computer prowess into action and created a fan website, hosted on the Caltech
server. “It was an authentic expression of being a fan of music. I loved the
music.” The page took off: hundreds of thousands of people found it as the band
skyrocketed from anonymity into stardom.

# Meaning

1. **Lekking** - Ritual in which males show off their desirability as mates.

- When it’s time to breed, they gather in a commonplace and take their
  established positions. They put on extravagant displays to impress and court
  female audiences. Some do mating dances. Some sing alluring songs. Some even
  do acrobatics.
